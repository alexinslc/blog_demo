3. **Small changes**: For typos or small bug fixes, feel free to submit a PR directly

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-comment-system
git checkout -b fix/user-authentication-bug
git checkout -b docs/update-installation-guide
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, concise code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear commit messages following this format:

```bash
git commit -m "Add comment system for blog posts

- Create Comment model with associations
- Add comment form to post show page
- Implement comment moderation
- Add tests for comment functionality"
```

**Good commit messages:**
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and PRs when applicable
- Keep the first line under 72 characters

### 4. Stay Up to Date

Regularly sync with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

## Pull Request Process

   ```bash
   rubocop
   ```

3. **Security checks pass**: No security vulnerabilities
   ```bash
   brakeman
   bundle audit check
   ```

4. **Documentation updated**: Update relevant documentation if needed

- Use CamelCase for classes and modules

### JavaScript Style

- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Git Commit Messages

- First line: 72 characters or less
- Blank line after first line
- Detailed explanation if necessary
- Reference issues with `#issue_number`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bin/rails test

# Run specific test file
bin/rails test test/models/post_test.rb

# Run system tests
bin/rails test:system

# Run with coverage
COVERAGE=true bin/rails test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Write tests for bug fixes to prevent regression
- Use meaningful test names
- Follow the existing test structure

**Example:**

```ruby
test "should create post with valid attributes" do
  post = Post.new(title: "Test", body: "Content", user: users(:one))
  assert post.save
end
```
